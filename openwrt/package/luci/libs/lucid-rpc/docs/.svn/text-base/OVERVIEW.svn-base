					LuCId JSON-RPC Server Slave
											
*** Abstract ***
The LuCId JSON-RPC server slave implements the JSON-RPC 1.0 and 2.0 protocol
to allow efficient light-weight remote procedure calling.
It provides notification support and several unofficial protocol extensions such
as:
	* Close notifications
	* Raw TCP switching to transfer BLOBs efficiently
	* Client notification


*** Workflow ***
After receiving an incoming connection from LuCId, the slave analyses the
request and passes it to the matching handler. The handler will enforce
access restriction and deserialize the payload data and invokes the assigned
Lua function in a protected way. In case of a success the handler will serialize
the response and send it to the client - otherwise a detailed error message
will be returned.
