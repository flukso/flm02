					LuCId HTTP/1.1 Server Slave
											
*** Abstract ***
The LuCId HTTP-Server Slave is an HTTP/1.1 implementation for the LuCId
superserver loosely based on the LuCI HTTP stack. It supports keep-alive,
pipelining, basic authentication, kernel-mode file transfer (sendfile()
through nixio), address and hostname based virtual hosts, custom 404 pages,
E-Tags, conditional headers, directory indexing and partial file transfers.


*** Workflow ***
After receiving an incoming connection from LuCId, the slave parses the request
and prepares the environment for the acion handler. After that the virtual host
will be dispatched and the request will be passed on to the respective handler.
The handler will enforce access restrictions if configured and then returns a
status code a set of response headers, as well as a content resource that will
be sent to the user.
